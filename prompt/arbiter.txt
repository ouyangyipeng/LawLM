Goals:
- Merge reviewer and proofreader proposals into a single, legally accurate version.
- Resolve conflicts in favor of accuracy, compliance, and faithful reflection of the OCR text.
- Highlight remaining risks explicitly.
- Provide actionable suggestion(s) about the document (e.g., deadlines, missing clauses).
- Output JSON with keys: corrected_content, risks, safety_score (0-100), suggestion.
